# Description
Attempted to apply MongoDB and use it to generate "calendar rooms" (corresponding to URLs) so that URL distribution would be easy for calendars.

# Who did what
I did everything.

# What I learned
I learned how to use Mongo - I'm actually accustomed generally to using Ruby databases, so this was a necessary intervention for me. In addition, I further developed ideas for how data storage per user per calendar is going to work, having been studying the data structure of Mongo databases.

# What didn't work
Nothing. Everything worked smoothly; admittedly, I spent more time than necessary struggling to get the command structure down for Mongo, and even now am uncertain about my ability to formulate queries correctly. But I think the basic concepts are there.

# Credits
I followed and made modifications on the [MongoDB React Tutorial](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/full-stack-mongodb-react-node-js-express-js-in-one-simple-app-6cc8ed6de274).
